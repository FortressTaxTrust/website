      question: "How Will Pass-Through Business Income Be Taxed After Transfer?",
      answer: "If you own a pass-through business (such as an S corporation, partnership, or LLC), the tax treatment of business income after transfer depends on whether it's classified as active, passive, or portfolio income. Active income is typically taxed more favorably, potentially qualifying for lower rates or loss deductions. However, determining active vs. passive income for a trust or estate is more complex than for individuals. Courts have ruled that participation is based on the fiduciary's (or their agent's) involvement in the business. Since IRS guidance is limited, proper trustee or executor selection is crucial to preserving favorable tax treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "Will an S Corporation Keep Its Tax Benefits After Transfer?",
      answer: "S corporations offer pass-through taxation, avoiding double taxation like C corporations. However, not all trusts or beneficiaries can hold S corporation stock—some require special elections, and foreign trusts, IRAs, and certain other entities are ineligible. After death, estates and certain trusts can hold S corporation stock temporarily, but long-term planning is key to maintaining eligibility."
    },
    {
      question: "Should You Transfer a Partnership Interest During Life or at Death?",
      answer: "Gifting a partnership interest during life keeps your original tax basis, while transferring at death may provide a step-up in basis, eliminating capital gains on appreciation. However, gifting can remove future growth from your taxable estate. If the partnership has a negative capital account, gifting could trigger unexpected tax liabilities. Holding until death may offer better tax efficiency, especially if the partnership makes certain elections (like a Sec. 754 step-up)."
    },
    {
      question: "How Will Beneficiaries Be Taxed on Inherited Retirement Accounts?",
      answer: "The SECURE Act changed distribution rules for inherited retirement accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s, etc.), requiring most non-spouse beneficiaries to withdraw funds within 10 years. Trusts inheriting these accounts face additional complexities. Roth conversions can be a smart strategy—paying taxes upfront to eliminate future tax burdens for heirs. Alternatively, leaving retirement accounts to charity can reduce overall tax liability."
